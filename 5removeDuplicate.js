//Question: How would you remove duplicate members from an array?

//Answer: will start a while looping and keep an object/ associated array. If i find an element for the first time i will set its value as true (that will tell me element added once.). if i find a element in the exists object, i will not insert it into the return array.

function removeDuplicate(arr) {
  var exists = {},
    outArr = [],
    elm;

  for (var i = 0; i < arr.length; i++) {
    elm = arr[i];
    if (!exists[elm]) {
      outArr.push(elm);
      exists[elm] = true;
    }
  }
  return outArr;
}

console.log(removeDuplicate([1, 3, 3, 3, 1, 5, 6, 7, 8, 1]));
//     = [1, 3, 5, 6, 7, 8]
